# Aviation Math

Single-file aviation calculator with offline-friendly tools for performance planning, navigation, and quick conversions.

**Calculations**
- C172 Performance (short-field takeoff/landing, climb, cruise, range)
- Conversions: Distance & Length
- Conversions: Speed (including Mach with OAT)
- Conversions: Vertical Speed
- Conversions: Temperature
- Conversions: Pressure
- Conversions: Fuel (volume, mass, flow)
- Conversions: Climb/Descent Gradient
- Conversions: Weight / Mass / Force
- Conversions: Time & Time Zones
- TOC & TOD (top of climb / descent planning)
- ETP & PNR (equal time point, point of no return)
- Meetpoint (head-on pass)
- VOR Triangle (distance from two radials)
- Lat/Long (distance and true course)
- True Airspeed (from IAS/CAS, pressure altitude, temperature)
- Speed • Distance • Time
- Wind • Angles (WCA, heading, GS, components, limits)
- Altitudes (PA, DA, TA)
- IFR Gradients (FPM, ft/nm, angles, TOD, required gradient)
- Pivotal Altitude
- 60-to-1 Rule (track error, intercept, time-to-fix)
- Clouds (base, top, thickness)
- Hydroplaning (dynamic Vp)
- Time Organizer (chain events, buffers, leave/arrive)
